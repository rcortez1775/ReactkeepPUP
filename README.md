# ReactkeepPUP

## Technologies
The keepPUP App uses ReactJS, NodeJS, Express and MySQL.

## How does it work?
Once a User creates a profile, the User is able to track all of their pet's activities. With the multiple pet options, a User can add or delete all their furry friends and track them individually. A user can add other members so they too receive notification of the pet event.
